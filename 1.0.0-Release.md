# What's new in Magento PHPStorm Plugin 1.0.0

This major release includes MFTF support, RequireJS mapping support, GraphQL support, Plugin declaration inspection,
code generation and many more.

## Code generation

The code generation is one of the most wanted feature in Magento community. There is a bunch of existing open source solutions, however, generating code using the IDE seems to be the most convenient way to go. Therefore several actions were created to help with common Magento 2 customizations. This list will be extended in the future.
All templates used for generation can be found and edited in `Preferences/Settings | Editor | File and Code Templates`.

### Create a new module

New Magento 2 module can be created from the context menu or by pressing Ctrl(⌘)+N.

### Create a new module as a separate project

This should be useful for extension developers. When the project is created IDE suggests selecting the PHP version and suggests including the Magento source code to PHP include paths.

### Create a plugin for a class public method

The action creates a plugin class method along with a plugin declaration record in di.xml in the scope of the specified module and area. A plugin class and di.xml being created if needed.

New observer can be created from the context menu. Just right click on the event name and specify the module, area, and observer name.

## Inspections

### Plugin inspection in the scope of PHP class

Inspection highlights the following cases:
* Plugin declared for a final class
* Plugin declared for a final method
* Plugin declared for a constructor
* Plugin declared for a not public method
* Plugin declared for a static method
* Incompatible parameter
* Redundant parameter

### Plugin duplication inspection in the scope of di.xml

This inspection highlights possible accidental plugin duplication.
Plugin name must be unique. In case if overriding is wanted, the best practice is to disable the original plugin and give a unique name to the current plugin.

### Observer duplication inspection in the scope of events.xml

Inspection for observer declaration records, similar to plugin one.

### GraphQL resolver inspection in the scope of PHP class (Requires GraphQLJS plugin)

If a class is configured in `schema.GraphQLs` as a resolver, it should implement one of the resolver interfaces.

### Cacheable false in the scope of the default layout

This inspection highlights the `cacheable` attribute which is set to be false in default.xml as that can make the whole site uncacheable.

## Reference and navigation

### Line markers from a Plugin class to a Target class

In the previous version existed a possibility to navigate from the target class and method to the plugin class and method via line markers. Now line markers for the navigation were added in the opposite direction.

### RequireJS mapping support

The RequireJS configuration file `requirejs-config.js` is commonly used in the different areas of Magento 2. There is a possibility to make aliases for a component using it. We added support of this mapping to have an ability to easily navigate between JS files.

* Reference on injected argument

### GraphQL support (Optional, Requires GraphQLJS plugin)

Sometimes you may need to quickly navigate from GraphQL resolver to schema and vice versa. Line markers were added to make it possible. To use this functionality please install [GraphQLJS plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8097-js-GraphQL).
